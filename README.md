## My Solution to the Stanford CS242 Final Lean Theorem Proving Project

This project contains my solutions for the final assignment of Stanford CS242: [Project Description](https://stanford-cs242.github.io/f19/assignments/final/lean).

The goal is to formalize the operational semantics of a simple arithmetic language and prove key properties using Lean 4.
